# Theme Config: Homepage

KduVite provides a homepage layout. To use it, specify `home: true` plus some other metadata in your root `index.md`'s [YAML frontmatter](../guide/frontmatter). This is an example of how it works:

```yaml
---
home: true
heroImage: /logo.png
heroAlt: Logo image
heroText: Hero Title
tagline: Hero subtitle
actionText: Get Started
actionLink: /guide/
features:
